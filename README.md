## Using Arial font in TOC

To use the Arial font in the table of contents, you need to download `getnonfreefonts` and then the add the Arial font.

You can do this by following these steps:

1. Download the installer from [here](https://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/).
2. Open a terminal, go to the folder where the installer was downloaded, and run `sudo texlua install-getnonfreefonts`.
3. Download the Arial font by running sudo `getnonfreefonts --sys arial-urw`.

## Using the template

I am not planning to make changes to this repository. You are free to use this template by downloading or forking the repository.
